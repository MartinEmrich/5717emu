5717emu
=======

Emulates the mouse controller chip inside a Commodore 1351 mouse for the Commodore 64.

I made this because the chip inside my mouse was broken. There are several other projects like this out there, but I did not find any source code... (and doing it by myself is more fun).

At present, it does NOT work as smoothly as the original chip, but better than a dead mouse.

Calibration
-----------

When you first run it with your mouse, you should "calibrate" it: The four photosensitive devices inside the mouse have different maximum voltages, I read somewhere that this is from ageing.
to calibrate, uncomment the `#define CALIBRATE` and run it while having the serial console open.
Right after starting, swirl around both axes for several (>10) seconds, to make sure the code sees the maximum value for each photodiode.

After a while, the four values are printed to the serial connection. Insert these into the code, comment out the calibration again and upload again. That should do it.

Open Issues
-----------

* No Joystick mode. I see no need to implement it at present.
* Right mouse button not supported. Should be easy to implement.
* SYNC detection is still jittery, probably the 5717 did it differently from the ATmega. This results in the mouse values jerk around a bit.
* transition from tristate to high leaves a signal artifact.
* Work around the calibration. The original 5717 did without it, so we should, too.
* Y signal looks different from X signal, surely due to the connection to SYNC. Original 5717 apparently did this differently.
